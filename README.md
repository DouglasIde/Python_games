# Python_games
I programmed two games in this project. A Hangman and a Guessing Game!!

Both codes I learned through Alura's course!!

The simplest guessing game where you need to guess the random number, generated by Python

The second game is a hangman game, where some words were distributed in the files in list forms!!
